# Lawrence_Wan QA Tech Spell Program

The text-based Spell DPS Calculator I wrote for my Riot Games QA internship application. With it, it finds the spell with the most DPS given an amount of time. 

This was written after my first semester of computer science, after learning introductory C++. I now know how to organize my code better and write more readable and efficient code. 

Uses the Riot API for champion info (pulled at the time of making this program).

Run spellefficiency.cpp to execute the program.
